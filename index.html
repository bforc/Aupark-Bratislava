<h2 data-start="2044" data-end="2087">A Vibrant Culinary and Social Experience</h2>
<p data-start="2089" data-end="2453">Aupark is not just about shopping—it's a destination for socializing, dining, and entertainment. The center features over <strong data-start="2211" data-end="2239">37 cafés and restaurants</strong>, covering a wide culinary spectrum from quick bites to gourmet meals. Whether you're grabbing a coffee at Costa or sitting down to a meal at a contemporary eatery, Aupark delivers a cosmopolitan dining experience.</p>
<p data-start="2455" data-end="2740">This appeal is reinforced by the recent addition of <strong data-start="2507" data-end="2522">EL&amp;N London</strong>, the Instagram-famous café brand known for its unique interiors and vibrant menu. With its pink floral decor and visually appealing dishes, EL&amp;N has become a major draw for younger crowds and digital content creators.</p>

<h2 data-start="2742" data-end="2788">Entertainment and Family-Friendly Amenities</h2>
<p data-start="2790" data-end="3193">Entertainment is a major pillar of the Aupark experience. A 12-screen <strong data-start="2860" data-end="2885">Cinema City multiplex</strong> (formerly Palace Cinemas) draws moviegoers from all parts of the city, offering a premium cinematic experience. Families will appreciate the professionally supervised <strong data-start="3053" data-end="3077">children's play area</strong>, while teens and young adults are drawn to <strong data-start="3121" data-end="3134">Gamestate</strong>, a modern arcade with bowling lanes and interactive games.</p>

<h2 data-start="3511" data-end="3543">Accessibility and Convenience</h2>
<p data-start="3545" data-end="3795">One of the biggest advantages of Aupark is its <strong data-start="3592" data-end="3614">strategic location</strong> and excellent accessibility.

It holds a <strong data-start="4325" data-end="4368">BREEAM ‘Excellent' In-Use certification</strong>, making it the first and only shopping center in Slovakia to achieve this level of environmental performance.</p>
<p data-start="4480" data-end="4835">Approximately <strong data-start="4494" data-end="4559">77% of its total energy use is derived from renewable sources</strong>, and the center has recently installed <strong data-start="4599" data-end="4628">photovoltaic solar panels</strong> to further reduce its carbon footprint. A unique <strong data-start="4678" data-end="4694">green façade</strong>, comprising over <strong data-start="4712" data-end="4729">40,000 plants</strong>, not only enhances the building's appearance but also contributes to improved air quality and insulation.</p>
<p data-start="4837" data-end="5155">These green initiatives are supported by practical solutions such as advanced waste recycling, energy-efficient lighting, and support for <strong data-start="4975" data-end="4989">e-mobility</strong> infrastructure. As sustainability becomes a key concern for tenants and visitors alike, Aupark continues to lead by example in the Central European retail landscape.</p>

<h2 data-start="5157" data-end="5193">Investment and Market Performance</h2>

This performance is supported by Aupark's robust foot traffic, high occupancy rate, and elite tenant portfolio.</p>

<h2 data-start="5877" data-end="5907">Expansion and Future Vision</h2>
<p data-start="5909" data-end="6234">In 2024, Aupark completed a significant <strong data-start="5949" data-end="5981">6,000 square meter expansion</strong>, bringing in new brands and updating its facilities to align with global retail trends.
